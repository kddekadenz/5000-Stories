# 5000-Stories
generates 5000 short stories using Plot Narrator

This is a simple hack of OneSadCookies Ruby port of my Plot Narrator algorithm.
I don't know any Ruby really, but I understood it enough to hack things together.
Blame me for my code, but it works.

P.S.: This now can be used for NaNoWriMo.
